===

## Learning Objectives

* String Permutations
* Code Review (homework)
* Stacks - First In Last Out - FILO
* Queues - First In First Out - FIFO
* Heaps - Special tree based data structure - Instant Lookup Time - O(1)
    * Based on Binary Tree
    * Priority Queue
    * O(1) max/min
    * O(log n) insert
* Sorting
    * what is the complexity of a sorting algorithm? O(n logn)
    * solution - setting left and right pointers
* Caching Hash
    * Given two strings write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other

## Problem Solving Techniques

### Divide and Conquer
    * break up problem
    * solve each part recursively
    * combine solutions to sub-problems into overall solution

### Greedy Algorithms
    * do the naive thing

## Dynamic Programming
* fibonacci
    * fib(n) = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    * f(1) = f(2) = 1 **OR** f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1

## Hash Tables
* taking an input and producing an output which points to a location in some structure
* keys
